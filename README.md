# Market_Game
MarketGame is an ongoing Qt development project wherein a user may interact with the TD Ameritrade API to search, view, and simulate their own trading strategy. MarketGame is based on Qt 5.15.2 (MSVC 2019, 64 bit), and requires OpenSSL to be installed as a prerequisite, as well as having a TD Ameritrade Developer Account to receive one of their API keys to function. Market Game is intended for tradeable security viewing only, and will not officially support sending orders through TD Ameritrade. Market Game contains implementations that fall under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007
