# Market_Game
MarketGame is an ongoing, open source, Qt development project wherein a user may interact with the TD Ameritrade API to search, view, and simulate their own trading strategy. MarketGame is based on Qt 5.15.2 (MSVC 2019, 64 bit), and requires OpenSSL to be installed as a prerequisite, as well as having a TD Ameritrade Developer Account to receive one of their API keys to function.
